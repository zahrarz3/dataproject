# Log File Analysis
## Introduction
This project involves the analysis of a log file to extract and analyze key fields such as IP address, timestamp, request method, URL, status code, response size, and query parameters. 
## Data Extraction and Cleaning
The log file was parsed using Python with the help of regular expressions to extract the relevant fields. The extracted data includes:
- IP Address
- Timestamp
- Request Method
- URL
- Status Code
- Response Size (bytes)
- Query Parameters

The extracted data was then cleaned to handle missing values, format inconsistencies, and invalid entries.

## Data Analysis and Visualizations
The analysis was performed using Python and libraries such as Pandas and Seaborn.
